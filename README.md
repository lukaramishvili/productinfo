This is a .NET (Windows Forms/Microsoft SQL Server) application for warehouse/retail store management.

I'm opening the code since open-source stopped being a deal-breaker in the local software industry.

* Warehouse/stock management
* Extensive bookkeeping and auditing tools
* Revenue Service (rs.ge) SOAP integration - invoice import/export
* Excel file generation
* POS
* Barcode scanner / barcode-encoded product weight detection
* Modular (decoupled) design
* Multiple concurrent user support
* ACL for multiple user types and groups
* Heavily optimized queries
* Uses Stored Procedures where needed (most of business logic resides in Stored Procedures)
